## Demo

Access the demo here : https://ohmygifs-123.firebaseapp.com/

### Prerequisites to run locally

On your local directory, clone the repo bar repository by running :

```
git clone https://github.com/thegirlfromipanema/ohmygifs
```

then, run :

```
npm install
```

then start the dev/local server :

```
npm start
```

to create the build :

```
npm build
```

### Technical Rationale

- I use ReactJS to modularize every element as a component, for more control over the DOM.

- For maintainability of an app this small, the state and methods are centralized in App.js.

- I deployed the application to Firebase, as it provides easy deployment and less error-prone compared to Heroku (only appropriate for tiny projects though).


## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org//) - The JS library used to modularize the DOM, centralize the data and make the UI interactive

* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Used for deployment
